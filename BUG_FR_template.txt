Problem Description: The SP mrg_complexupdpatnotif looks for any notification that wasn't completed.

Background: I would believe that this was implemented, in case there was an account that had a pending notification.

Issue: There could be notification years,months, and days ago that weren't completed for any type of reason.
Cause: Issues that took time resolve with patient notification, turned off notification, ect.

Additional Comments:
I think this SP should be altered to only look for future notifications that haven't been completed.

Proposed Solution (per Chatter comments):
1. Remove the existing "complex" logic handling PNNotifications. This can be done by commenting out the call to [mrg_complexupdpatnotif] in [mrg_complextablesupd].
2. To account for the legacy PNNotifications table, modify [mrg_seedvalidtables] to house it under a "simple mergetype" with an "ACCOUNT simplemergekey".

As reference, FR-002243 has been created to account for MINotify tables. This will involve:
(a) Working with John Shore to document what MINotify tables are affected by PAM
(b) Updating stored proc [mrg_complexupdpatnotif] accordingly
(c) Uncommenting the call to [mrg_complexupdpatnotif] in [mrg_complextablesupd]
(d) Modifying [mrg_seedvalidtables] to account for the MINotify tables
